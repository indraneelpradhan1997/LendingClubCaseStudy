## Goals of data analysis

```
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs 
away with the money owed.

Main objective is to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby 
cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of 
this case study.

Performing analysis on the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables
which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and 
risk assessment.
